This is a sample Android project that demonstrates a typical [Bitrise](https://bitrise.io) CI/CD setup. Build history is publicly available [here](https://app.bitrise.io/app/126b7fcfb72b97b4#/builds).

## Project setup and config

### Bitrise workflow

There are two Bitrise workflows configured: `primary` and `deploy`. `primary` is triggered by any commit on any branch, while `deploy` can be started manually. The `primary` workflow builds and tests only the debug variant, meanwhile `deploy` builds a release app and signs it with the release signing config.

#### Release builds

- R8 obfuscation and minification enabled in `build.gradle`
- No signing config in Gradle, builds are signed by the Sign step on Bitrise
- Signing keystore and passwords are stored securely on Bitrise
- Auto-incrementing `versionCode` based on the [Bitrise build number](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/build-numbering-and-app-versioning/)

### Testing

#### UI tests

UI tests are run on emulators with the [Virtual Device Testing](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/virtual-device-testing-for-android) step.

## Advanced use cases

While this repo demonstrates a simple project config on Bitrise, there are many advanced features that might be relevant for your project:

- [Generating multiple APKs (multi-flavor) in one workflow](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/deploy/android-deploy/generate-and-deploy-multiple-flavor-apks-in-a-single-workflow/)
- [Exporting a universal APK from an AAB](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/deploy/android-deploy/exporting-a-universal-apk-from-an-aab/)
- [Running tests in Visual Studio App Center](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/testing/run-your-tests-in-the-app-center/)
- [Measuring your code coverage with Codecov](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/testing/measuring-your-code-coverage-with-codecov/)
